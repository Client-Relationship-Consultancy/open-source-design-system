Before submitting my PR to Code Review, I have made sure:

- [ ] I have run the tests using `yarn run test`
- [ ] I have exported any new files in index.js
- [ ] My file supports Formik if will potentially be used in a form
- [ ] The PR name follows the convention `(#<ticket_number>) - <ticket_user_story>`
- [ ] I have incremented the version in `package.json` if I want to publish a new version
- [ ] If my change is breaking I have updated the minor version number(i.e. the middle one) and don't merge until I have the PR on Corazon ready
